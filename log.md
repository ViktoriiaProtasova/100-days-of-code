# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed HTML, CSS, JS worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with JS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
